%I am a molecular biologist by training with 15 years of experience working on the genetics of disease vector mosquitoes. I am interested in the development and implementation of novel vector control strategies aiming to reduce the transmission of vector borne pathogens, especially malaria and dengue virus. I was born and raised near Blythe, California in the remote expanses of the Sonoran desert. After receiving my bachelor's degree from The University of California at Berkeley, I obtained a post-baccalaureate training fellowship at The Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta, \acr{GA}. At the end of my fellowship, I joined the laboratory of then Director General Fotis Kafatos at The European Molecular Biology Laboratory \acr{(EMBL)} in Heidelberg, Germany. In 2003, I returned to the United States to pursue a doctorate at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health in Baltimore, \acr{MD}. After earning my doctorate, I began working for the French National Institutes of Science and Medical Research \acr{(INSERM)} at the \emph{Institute de biologie mol\'{e}culaire et cellulaire} \acr{(IBMC)} in Strasbourg, France. At the conclusion of my contract with \acr{INSERM}, I returned home to California, where I have lived since.
