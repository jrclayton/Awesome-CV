%I am a molecular biologist by training with 15 years of experience working on the genetics of disease vector mosquitoes. My research has focused on the development and implementation of novel vector control strategies aiming to reduce the transmission of vector borne pathogens, especially malaria and dengue virus. Other research areas of interest to me include the application of recent advances in the field of innate immunology to rational vaccine design and development as well as the emerging  market for personal genomic information.

%\lettersection{My~Background}
%
%I was born and raised near Blythe, California in the remote expanses of the Sonoran desert. After receiving my bachelor's degree from UC Berkeley, I obtained a training fellowship at The Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta, \acr{GA}. Subsequently, I joined the laboratory of Fotis Kafatos, then  Director General at The European Molecular Biology Laboratory \acr{(EMBL)} in Heidelberg, Germany. In 2003, I returned to the United States to pursue a doctorate at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health in Baltimore, \acr{MD}. After earning my doctorate, I accepted a position as a post-doctoral researcher for the French National Institute of Science and Medical Research \acr{(INSERM)} at the \emph{Institute de biologie mol\'{e}culaire et cellulaire} \acr{(IBMC)} in Strasbourg, France. At the conclusion of my contract with \acr{INSERM}, I returned home to California, where I now live.

%\lettersection{The Right Fit}
%
%I am an expert microbiologist with a knack for technical improvement and troubleshooting in the laboratory and such a temperament would appear to be an asset not only for the ideal candidate but for your enterprise as a whole. I have more than 15 years of experience working in research laboratories and I hold a PhD in Microbiology \& Immunology from Johns Hopkins University. I also have extensive experience with many molecular biology and biochemistry techniques in addition to the writing, presentation and communication skills required for advancement in academic research.
%
%\lettersection{My~Qualities}
%
%I am a socially capable individual who possesses a talent for bridging the gap between lay and technical audiences. Though trained as a laboratory research scientist, I have made efforts to broaden my bioinformatics skillset in recent years. I am an intelligent and accomplished individual capable of independent and autonomous research. I have been informed personally on numerous occasions and by course evaluations that my teaching performance is of high quality. Years in research have taught me effective ways to communicate my concepts, thoughts and ideas. As such, I consider myself to be a strong and confident speaker and communicator of information.
%
%Friends and family have described me at various times as tenacious, consistent with the temperament of someone seeking to pursue and complete a doctoral program. However, the field of experimental research itself influences temperament and fosters the development of certain skills in its own right, such as critical thinking and objectivity with respect to the analysis of data. It is for this reason that I do not become intractably wedded to ideas. I have the capacity to admit fault and error and to take responsibility for those, if appropriate. Furthermore, I recognize that I am capable of changing my beliefs in the face of contrary evidence.
%
%Another skill I've learned from my career in scientific research is how to adapt. From living and working abroad to learning new subjects to learning new experimental techniques, being able to adapt to new environments and people and methods is nearly always important to move forward. In that same vein are the set of skills related to diplomacy and working to achieve mutual goals without conflict. Living abroad made me feel like an ambassador to the US in many ways and I used that unintended role as an opportunity to represent America in a positive way. I have traditionally had good positive working relationships with the great majority of my colleagues and I believe myself to be generally well-regarded by my peers.
%
%I believe most people who know me would describe me as an agreeable and interesting person. Over the past 20 years, I have lived in seven cities in three US states and two foreign countries. In addition to native English, I can also speak French, Spanish and German with varying degrees of proficiency.
%
%In summary, I am a scientific renaissance man. There is very little I can't either do or figure out how to do on my own. Personable, organized and expert with computers, I am trained in a wide range of methods and techniques in the laboratory and beyond.

%Please feel free to contact me with any further questions you may have.

The COS human resources department advised me to contact you regarding potential openings for the Fall 2017 semester.

I am a molecular biologist by training with 15 years of experience working on the genetics of disease vector mosquitoes. My research has focused on the development and implementation of novel vector control strategies aiming to reduce the transmission of vector borne pathogens, especially malaria and dengue virus. I am also an expert microbiologist with a an extensive set of laboratory skills. Though trained as a laboratory scientist, in recent years I have made efforts to broaden my bioinformatics skill set as well.

Years in research have taught me effective ways to communicate my concepts, thoughts and ideas. I've been told that I possesses a talent for bridging the gap between lay and technical audiences. To that end, I consider myself to be a strong and confident speaker and communicator of information. I have been informed personally on numerous occasions and through course feedback that my teaching performance is of high quality.

Most people who know me would describe me as an agreeable and interesting person. Over the past 20 years, I have lived in seven cities in three US states and two foreign countries. In addition to native English, I can also speak French, Spanish and German with varying degrees of proficiency.

I was born and raised near Blythe, California, in the remote expanses of the Sonoran desert.

Then in 2010 I earned a doctorate from the Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, MD. I've been living in California since 2015.

To summarize, I'm sort of a scientific renaissance man. There is very little I can't either do or figure out how to do on my own. Personable, organized and expert with computers, I am trained in a wide range of methods and techniques inside and outside of the laboratory.

Feel free to contact me with any further questions you may have.

%%% I made a weaknesses list too, so this is how I wrote it up. Not so apropos for cover letter.

%\lettersection{Weaknesses}

%The origins of the neurological conditions we call ``mood disorders,'' including major depression, remain uncertain. The evolutionary basis for the appearance of mood disorders has been hypothesized to explain food sharing and capitulation to displays of dominance [ref]. I was in my mid-20s when I was diagnosed with depression, which is a very typical age of onset and diagnosis.

%There is a paradox in the scientific research community. It goes something like this: we're all in an intellectual pissing contest, but we must all feign the greatest modesty, humility and humbleness, lest we be accused of those worse-than-death social taboos of arrogance and braggadocio. To my regret and eternal dismay, I possess these in abundance. Those who possess the least self-awareness seem to excel. We see this in many walks of life. Better still though is to obtain a healthy balance between confidence in ones-self and an objective assessment of one's own abilities with the modesty and humility that invariably comes from living life on Earth with other human beings and being aware of that fact. All best in moderation. Unfortunately, a characteristic of my behavior that has become more pronounced since my diagnosis is a certain aversion to confrontation.
