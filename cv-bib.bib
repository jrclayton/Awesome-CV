%%% THESIS %%%
@thesis{Clayton2010,
	Abstract = {Arthropod-borne viruses (arboviruses) cause morbidity and mortality worldwide. Sindbis virus (SV) is an arbovirus and the prototype alphavirus. Recombinant alphaviruses were constructed to express cellular and virus-derived virulence factors in a vertebrate host, Mus musculus, and an invertebrate host, Aedes aegypti. Mosquitoes are responsible for transmitting numerous pathogens of public health importance, including dengue and yellow fever viruses and the malaria parasite. Understanding the host response to virus infection will aid in developing novel disease control strategies. We developed a prime-challenge model of infection in mosquitoes to determine whether the anti-viral response mounted during a virus infection affects the outcome of a subsequent hyper-virulent infection by a related virus (SV-B2). Mosquitoes primed with SV were completely protected from a subsequent hyper-virulent challenge. Acquired resistance to SV-B2 is rapidly established and persists throughout life. Acquired protection is completely dependent on a productive primary infection, as neither UV-inactivated SV nor replication incompetent SV were able to elicit the protective phenotype. However, replication competent infectious RNA is sufficient to both initiate an infection and produce protection. Protection observed against a ``killer'' virus following a prime from an innocuous strain of the virus demonstrates acquired immunity to virus infection in a non-chordate animal, the potency of which illustrates the functional capacity of the mosquito anti-viral response. The Drosophila death gene reaper was evaluated as a candidate biopesticide effector molecule. Reaper is an important regulator of programmed cell death responsible for activating caspases by binding inhibitors of apoptosis and targeting them for degradation. Mosquitoes infected per os with an insect-derived strain of SV expressing Reaper displayed enhanced mortality compared to controls, indicating the feasibility of this strategy to kill insects. The NSs protein from the Orthobunyavirus San Angelo virus is an important virulence determinant that bears sequence similarity to Reaper. NSs is presumed to exert its virulence by inhibiting host gene expression, but the mechanism of NSs toxicity remains unknown. Mice infected with SV-NSs display enhanced mortality that is dependent on residues shared with Reaper. Expression of virulence factors in distinct infection models highlights similarities and differences in requirements for virulence in animals in vivo.},

@article{Lamacchia2013,
	Abstract = {Anopheles gambiae mosquitoes are the major vectors of human malaria parasites. However, mosquitoes are not passive hosts for parasites, actively limiting their development in vivo. Our current understanding of the mosquito antiparasitic response is mostly based on the phenotypic analysis of gene knockdowns obtained by RNA interference (RNAi), through the injection or transfection of long dsRNAs in adult mosquitoes or cultured cells, respectively. Recently, RNAi has been extended to silence speci fi cally one allele of a given gene in a heterozygous context, thus allowing to compare the contribution of different alleles to a phenotype in the same genetic background.},

@article{Lobo2006,
	Abstract = {The ability to manipulate the mosquito genome through germ-line transformation provides us with a powerful tool for investigating gene structure and function. It is also a valuable method for the development of novel approaches to combating the spread of mosquito-vectored diseases. To date, germ-line transformation has been demonstrated in several mosquito species. Transgenes are introduced into pre-blastocyst mosquito embryos using microinjection techniques that take a few hours, and progeny are screened for the presence of a marker gene. The microinjection protocol presented here can be applied to most mosquitoes and contains several improvements over other published methods that increase the survival of injected embryos and, therefore, the number of transformants. Transgenic lines can be established in approximately 1 month using this technique.},

@article{Meister2005,
	Abstract = {We show that, in the malaria vector Anopheles gambiae, expression of Cecropin 1 is regulated by REL2, an NF-kappaB-like transcription factor orthologous to Drosophila Relish. Through alternative splicing, REL2 produces a full-length (REL2-F) and a shorter (REL2-S) protein isoform lacking the inhibitory ankyrin repeats and death domain. RNA interference experiments show that, in contrast to Drosophila Relish, which responds solely to Gram-negative bacteria, the Anopheles REL2-F and REL2-S isoforms are involved in defense against the Gram-positive Staphylococcus aureus and the Gram-negative Escherichia coli bacteria, respectively. REL2-F also regulates the intensity of mosquito infection with the malaria parasite, Plasmodium berghei. The adaptor IMD shares the same activities as REL2-F. Microarray analysis identified 10 additional genes regulated by REL2, including CEC3, GAM1, and LRIM1.},

@article{Grossman2001,
	Abstract = {Germline transformation of the major African malaria vector, Anopheles gambiae, was achieved using the piggyBac transposable element marked with the enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) injected into mosquito embryos. Two G1 generation male mosquitoes expressing EGFP were identified among 34 143 larvae screened. Genomic Southern data and sequencing of the piggyBac insertion boundaries showed that these two males arose from one piggyBac insertion event in the injected G0 embryos. Genetic cross data suggest that the insertion site of the element either resulted in, or is tightly linked to, a recessive lethal. This was demonstrated by a deficiency in the number of EGFP-expressing offspring from inbred crosses but expected ratios in outcrosses to non-transformed individuals and failure to establish a pure-breeding line. The insertion was weakly linked to the collarless locus on chromosome 2 and was shown by in situ hybridization to be located in division 28D of that chromosome. Particularly high levels of expression were observed uniformly in salivary glands and, in most individuals, in the anterior stomach. An improvement in the injection technique at the end of the studies resulted in increased G0 hatching, transient expression and EGFP-expression rates among G1 progeny.},
